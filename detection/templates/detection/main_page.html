            Fake news, also known as junk news or pseudo-news, is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional news media (print and broadcast) or online social media.The false information is often caused by reporters paying sources for stories, an unethical practice called checkbook journalism. Digital news has brought back and increased the usage of fake news, or yellow journalism.The news is then often reverberated as misinformation in social media but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well.</p></div>

            The rapid growth of fake news, especially in social media has become a challenging
			problem that has negative social impacts on a global scale. In contrast to fake news which intends
			to deceive and manipulate the reader, satirical stories are designed to entertain the reader by
			ridiculing or criticizing a social figure. Due to its serious threats of misleading information,
			researchers, governments, journalists and fact- checking volunteers are working together to
			address the fake news issue and increase the accountability of digital media. The automatic fake
			news detection systems enable identification of deceptive news. Low accuracy remains the main
			drawback of these systems.</p>

            <p>We used dataset obtained from Kaggle and a list of sources from OpenSources.co, we
				applied term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of bi-grams and Count
				Vectorizer to a corpus of about 20000 articles for feature extraction. <span class="citation">"Fake News Bad"</span> We trained 5 different
				models for the accumulated data set and found that Logistic regression was the better of all with
				an accuracy of 85%. By adding additional features like click-bait analysis and publisher rating,
				models efficiency was increased to 88%.</p>
